## Overview
The assignment requires an investigation into the R data set "mtcars".
The data set is for a collection of cars, and we are asked in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). We are particularly interested in the following two questions:

- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG
- Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions
